Hey team! 🚀

This is our official GitHub repo for the Collaborative AI-Powered Project Platform:  
🔗 https://github.com/pratyushranjn/collab-ai-project-platform

📁 Folder structure is ready:
- `frontend/` with React + Tailwind + Vite
- `backend/` with Node.js + MongoDB

✅ Please accept the collaborator invite  
✅ Clone the repo and set up your folder (backend or frontend)  
✅ We'll divide tasks and start sprinting! 💻  

⚠️ Direct pushes to `main` can cause merge conflicts and slow everyone down — avoid them.

Let’s build this together and crush it! 💪🚀
